Description: A light-weight package helps you track and visualize
  the progress of parallel version of vectorized R functions (mc*apply).
  Parallelization (mc.core > 1) works only on *nix (Linux, Unix such as macOS) system due to
  the lack of fork() functionality, which is essential for mc*apply, on Windows.
