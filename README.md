Please check this [blog article](https://kevinkuang.net/tracking-progress-in-r-ad97998c359f) for an comparasion between available methods to track progress in R.

**Notice:** This package works on *nix (Linux, Unix such as macOS) only due to the lack of fork() functionality, which is essential for mcapply, on Windows.
